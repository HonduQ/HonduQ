Hello, I’m Cliff. 

About me:

3) I have mostly worked with `Python's Django framework`, but I have also been developing a `NextJS user authentication service` for the app and am enjoying getting to know a little `JavaScript`. I am using `MySQL` and `prisma` for databases
4) I am currently developing `Middleware authentication` between `Django` and the `NextJS microservice`

7) Things `I will miss` about my current job:
  - Working outside with my hands on trains
  - The people I've gotten to know and grow with
  - Getting to know new people and spend time training them regularly
8) Things `I'm looking forward to` with my next job:
  - `Working through obstacles` and `learning to view problems as opportunities to grow`
