Hi, I’m Cliff. I come from the labor sector, and I am looking for my first official role as an employee at a tech company!

I am a graduate of the `Coding Dojo` online coding bootcamp, and I have been building a `Barn Manager app` with help from `mstephenhunt`, who is a senior developer at Territory Foods. (You can find this project at `https://github.com/mstephenhunt/holiday_acres`.) 

I have mostly worked with `Python's` `Django` framework, but I have also been developing a `NextJS user authentication service` for the app and am enjoying getting to know `JavaScript`. Our Django database is in `MySQL`, and `prisma` for NextJS.

My current focus of study is `Middleware in NextJS`, specifically `authenticating requests with a secret key` and `verifying users via a token`.

Thanks for stopping in! You can reach me at `HonduQ@gmail.com`
